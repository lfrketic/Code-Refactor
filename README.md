# Frketic's Very First Code-Refactor
# üèóÔ∏è Demonstrate My Growing Ability to Apply HTML and CSS 

As my first homework activity for the UCF Full-Stack Bootcamp, I refactored the html and css code for the HORISEO website. 

## History of Actions Taken

On the following website, I changed many of the generic html code to semantic code.  

My first step in the process was a review of the index.html and style.css files.  In the files, I observed a number of "div" tags and styling techniques for the use of generic html. 

My second step was a review of the W3 school's semantic html tags.  I developed a replacement for each of the generic tags and replaced them in the index.html doc.  I used the semantic html tags for header, footer, section, main, aside, etc...  

As I completed each of the substitutions, I observed the corresponding css code.  I used the help of my tutor (Juan Delgado)to assist me with the css changes.  My initial attempt was too accomodative to the original div tags.  With Juan's help, I was able to reduce much of the style code by almost 70% by using style attributes focused on elements and not the class.  

The final code resembled the required image exactly. The site is viewable at https://github.com/lfrketic/Code-Refactor.git (See the following image for a replica:

I enjoyed the project.  The process of changing code provided me with an opportunity to build confidence with html and css.  

## Assessment

In order to assess my ability to apply semantic html code in lieu of the more generic html, I am providing the following resources:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
