# Frketic's Very First Code-Refactor
# üèóÔ∏è Demonstrate My Growing Ability to Apply HTML and CSS 

As my first homework activity for the UCF Full Stack Bootcamp partner to implement the following user story:

## Changes to review

On the following website, I changed many of the generic html code to semantic code.  

My first step in the process was a review of the index.html and style.css files.  In the files, I observed a number of "div" tags and styling techniques for the use of generic html. 

My second step was a review of the W3 school's semantic html tags.  I developed a replacement for each of the generic tags and replaced them in the index.html doc.  I used the semantic html tags for header, footer, section, main, aside, etc...  

As I completed each of the substitutions, I observed the corresponding css code.  I was able to reduce much of the style code by almost 70% by using style attributes focused on elements and not the class.  

I enjoyed the project.  The process of changing html code provided me with an opportunity to build confidence with html and css.  

## Assessment

In order to assess my ability to apply semantic html code in lieu of the more generic html, I am providing the following resources:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
